# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a modern sidebar navigation system for the SAFE Care System's admin and caregiver dashboards. The sidebar will replace the current tab-based navigation with a more intuitive, space-efficient, and scalable navigation solution that provides quick access to all dashboard sections while maintaining the healthcare-focused flat design principles.
