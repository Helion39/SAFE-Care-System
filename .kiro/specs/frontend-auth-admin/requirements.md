# Requirements Document - Frontend Authentication & Admin Management

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating the frontend user interface for the SAFE Care System authentication and admin management functionality. The system needs a modern, intuitive login interface and comprehensive admin panels for managing users (caregivers) and residents. This builds upon the existing backend API to provide a complete user management workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication Interface

**User Story:** As a caregiver or admin, I want to log into the system with my credentials, so that I can access my role-specific dashboard and functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a login form with username and password fields
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and redirect to their role-specific dashboard
3. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL store their authentication token securely
5. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect them to the login page
6. WHEN a user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect to the login page
7. WHEN a user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to their dashboard instead of showing the login form

### Requirement 2: Admin User Management Interface

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to create and manage caregiver accounts, so that I can control who has access to the system and ensure proper staffing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the user management section THEN the system SHALL display a list of all caregiver accounts
2. WHEN an admin clicks "Add New Caregiver" THEN the system SHALL display a form with fields for username, password, full name, and contact information
3. WHEN an admin submits a valid caregiver creation form THEN the system SHALL create the account and display a success message
4. WHEN an admin submits an invalid caregiver form THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation errors
5. WHEN an admin views the caregiver list THEN the system SHALL show each caregiver's name, username, status, and last login
6. WHEN an admin clicks on a caregiver THEN the system SHALL display detailed information and editing options
7. WHEN an admin deactivates a caregiver account THEN the system SHALL prevent that caregiver from logging in
8. WHEN an admin creates multiple caregivers THEN the system SHALL provide a bulk creation interface for efficiency

### Requirement 3: Admin Resident Management Interface

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to add and manage resident information, so that caregivers have access to essential resident details for proper care.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the resident management section THEN the system SHALL display a list of all residents
2. WHEN an admin clicks "Add New Resident" THEN the system SHALL display a form with fields for name, room number, age, and medical conditions
3. WHEN an admin submits a valid resident creation form THEN the system SHALL create the resident record and display a success message
4. WHEN an admin submits an invalid resident form THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation errors including duplicate room numbers
5. WHEN an admin views the resident list THEN the system SHALL show each resident's name, room, age, assigned caregiver, and status
6. WHEN an admin clicks on a resident THEN the system SHALL display detailed information and editing options
7. WHEN an admin updates resident information THEN the system SHALL save changes and notify assigned caregivers
8. WHEN an admin deletes a resident THEN the system SHALL require confirmation and handle associated data properly

### Requirement 4: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to see only the features and data appropriate for my role, so that the interface is relevant and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a caregiver logs in THEN the system SHALL display only caregiver-appropriate navigation and features
2. WHEN an admin logs in THEN the system SHALL display full admin navigation including user and resident management
3. WHEN a caregiver attempts to access admin features THEN the system SHALL deny access and display an appropriate message
4. WHEN a user's role changes THEN the system SHALL update their interface permissions immediately
5. WHEN displaying resident information THEN caregivers SHALL only see residents assigned to them while admins see all residents
6. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL validate permissions on both frontend and backend

### Requirement 5: Responsive Design and User Experience

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want the interface to work well on different devices and be easy to use during busy shifts, so that I can efficiently manage my responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the system on mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL be fully functional and touch-friendly
2. WHEN using the system on tablets THEN forms and lists SHALL be optimized for tablet interaction
3. WHEN navigating between sections THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and loading states SHALL be clear
4. WHEN forms have validation errors THEN error messages SHALL be clearly visible and helpful
5. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and confirmation
6. WHEN the system is loading data THEN appropriate loading indicators SHALL be displayed
7. WHEN using the system in different lighting conditions THEN text and controls SHALL remain clearly visible

### Requirement 6: Data Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to prevent and handle errors gracefully, so that I can complete my tasks without frustration or data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering data in forms THEN the system SHALL validate input in real-time and show helpful error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN required fields are empty THEN the system SHALL prevent form submission and highlight missing fields
5. WHEN duplicate data is entered THEN the system SHALL prevent creation and explain the conflict
6. WHEN session expires during form entry THEN the system SHALL preserve form data and allow re-authentication
7. WHEN validation fails THEN error messages SHALL be specific and actionable
