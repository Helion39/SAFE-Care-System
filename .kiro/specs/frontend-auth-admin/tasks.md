# Implementation Plan - Frontend Authentication & Admin Management

## Overview
This implementation plan converts the frontend authentication and admin management design into actionable coding tasks. Each task builds incrementally to create a complete user login system and admin interface for managing users and residents.

## ðŸŽ¯ **CRITICAL ADMIN FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:**
